                Once upon a time a student from ITU had to do some experimenting with HTML, CSS and Javascript as a part
                of his course.
            </div>
            <div class="chapter-box__text">
                He had some ideas for what he could do, but kinda lacked the knowledge on how to implement it properly.
            </div>
            <div class="chapter-box__text">
                There was only one thing to do! He had to study even more!

                He pushed everything important in his life aside in order to make the best assignment his teacher would
                ever see!
            </div>
            <div class="chapter-box__text">
                Cat videos were replaced with coding tutorials, Stackoverflow became his second home, and eventually he
                saw everything as code.
            </div>
            <div class="chapter-box__text">
                But he still kept on because he wasn't going to stop before he would reach his goal!

                At one point he hit a wall! He was ready to give up! He had made some changes to his code based on what
                he was absolutely sure would work - but it didn't.
            </div>
            <div class="chapter-box__text">
                With a severe feeling of defeat he considered other options for a career, preferably something where he
                would be within reach of chocolate for comfort eating.
            </div>
            <div class="chapter-box__text">
                He then realised that he made a barely noticeable typo in the code. After that was corrected, everything
                worked again and he carried on!

                At last he was done! After many hours of work, he was ready to hand in his assignment! The same day his
                teacher contacted him and told him that it was the best assignment in the history of the university!
            </div>
            <div class="chapter-box__text">
                He was awarded with everything possible - fame, money, respect and anything else one can desire!
            </div>
            <div class="chapter-box__text">
                He then woke up from his dream. He had fallen asleep in front of his computer - still unable to display
                the links properly.
